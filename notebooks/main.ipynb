    "In this notebook, I want to compare different approaches to image segmentation on a simple everyday example. I am thinking of using a photograph of lemons (or strawberries), process the image in black and white and apply various algorithm, from simple to complicated, and comment on the result. For each segmetnation, I would need a list of procs and cons, so that each next method is more sophisticated, more efficient, more exact, but also more time-consuming."
